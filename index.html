  <h1>NRL Salary Cap</h1>
  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      The National Rugby League (NRL) is Australia's premier rugby league competition. The league in its various forms has been running since 1908.  In 1990, the league introduced a salary cap in an attempt to level the playing field between participating clubs. I've set out to see if the cap made the competition more even by investigating the which teams have won the minor premiership over the past fifty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, the chart shows two series. The first, in black, is the number of seasons elapsed since the current minor premier last won. ie. A value of zero means the club has won two years in a row. Hovering over the line will show you which team won that season. The second, in red, shows a value which for each season is the mean number of years each participating club has gone without winning.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can add further series by clicking on the various teams in the legend. These individual team series show how many years have passed since the selected team last won the minor premiership or, if they haven't won yet, entered the competition. A value of zero means the club won that year.
